		<p>My name is Ricky Bloxsom, I am a young, independent designer based in Boston, Massachusetts. I have a deep love of what I do, I aim to deliver thought provoking and visually appealing design for any client. I specialise in print design, interface design & responsive web design.</p>
		<p>Sometimes working alone is not practical or cost effective so I am willing to work with you, the client, to grow or shrink the scope of any project to meet your needs and then find the right partners to work with us to complete the project.</p>
		<p>The time I spent studying at the Massachusetts College of Art and Design allowed me to gain experience working on a broad range of projects and also gave me time to develop and discuss philosophies about design. I approach my work as problem solving and believe that design is the way to do that either visually, conceptually or functionally. Whether it be a branding, service design or a user experience problem, design can help you connect with your clients in new, more effective ways.  If you would like to discuss a project, please email or call.</p>
