		<p>
		My name is Ricky Bloxsom, I am a young, independent designer based in Boston, Massachusetts. I have a deep love of what I do, and with this, I can deliver thought provoking and visually appealing design for any client in both the private and public sectors. I specialise in print design, interface design & responsive design for the web.
		</p>
		<p>
		Sometimes working alone is not practical or cost effective so I am willing to work with you, the client, to grow or shrink the scope of any project to meet your needs and then find the right freelancers to work with us to complete the project.
		</p>
		<p>
		The time I spent studying at the Massachusetts College of Art and Design allowed me to gain experience working on a broad range of projects and also gave me time to develop and discuss philosophies about design, I am of the belief that there is always a problem to be solved and that this is the true purpose of graphic design. Whether it be a branding, service design or a user experience problem, graphic design can help you connect with your clients in new, more effective ways.  If you would like to discuss a project, please email or call.
