I was adding in the header image just cause I felt like it using this line ( <img alt='Dogs versus Cats' a href='/' src='images/dogvscat-logo.gif'/>  ) and the image was working and showing up but when I ran it through the validator, it only had an issue with the greater than symbol at the end, couldn't really figure out why.

Just thought I'd mention it

Thanks,
Ricky
